# Maxwell
This repo contains the mathematical and computational model used to design and optimize a linear accelerator based on the following design. A set of coils, each actuated by a power transistor and powered by a capacitor accelerate a projectile containing a powered coil and no ferrous components. A sensor system will be integrated into the accelerator in order to allow for electronic timing of the power transistors. 

Additional complexities that may be included are:

1) Electronic actuation of the projectile coils via a laser in the accelerator pointed at a phototransistor in the projectile.

The focus of this repository is to develop a piece of code complex enough to predict projectile velocities, power efficienies, thermal efficiencies and required voltage/current for operation at specific velocities.
